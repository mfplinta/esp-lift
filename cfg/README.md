# Configuration

If connecting Wi-Fi to a router is desired, be sure to fill `settings.json` with your Wi-Fi SSID and password based on the given template.

Create it from the template with:

```sh
cp settings.template.json settings.json
```

Also feel free to add predefined exercises inside `exercises.json`.
